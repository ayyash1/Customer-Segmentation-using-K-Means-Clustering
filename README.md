# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project performs customer segmentation using the **Mall Customer Dataset** from Kaggle. By clustering customers based on their annual income and spending score, businesses can better target marketing strategies and personalize services.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project includes:

- Loading and preprocessing the **Mall Customer Dataset**
- Scaling features and visualizing data distributions
- Applying **K-Means Clustering** to identify distinct customer segments
- Determining the **optimal number of clusters** using the Elbow Method
- Visualizing customer clusters using 2D plots
- **Bonus:** Exploring alternative clustering algorithms like **DBSCAN**
- **Bonus:** Analyzing **average spending per cluster**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `Python`
- `Pandas`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Scikit-learn`

---

## 📚 Covered Topics

- **Clustering**
- **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Dimensionality Reduction & Visualization**

## 📊 Results

- Clusters of customers identified visually in 2D space
- Insights into different income/spending behavior groups
- Optional use of DBSCAN for alternative clustering comparison
- Spending behavior analysis across clusters

---

## 📈 Bonus Ideas
- Try hierarchical clustering
- Add gender or age features to improve segmentation
- Deploy with a simple Flask or Streamlit app
